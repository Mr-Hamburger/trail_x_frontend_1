# TrailX Front-End UI/UX Development

My work during my intership at TrailX, a start-up application from a group of students at Boston University.
This app is about finding, tracking, participatin in various hiking, climbing, biking and walking trails in an user's local area. Users will be able to enter their personal data and personalized trails, equipment, and health suggestions will be present to the user dynamically.

My role in this project is to translate UI/UX design on Figma to make an actual application using Flutter. From this project, I've learned how to develope the front-end aspect of an app using Flutter / Dart / C++ / CMake and such involved languages.
